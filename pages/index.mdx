### Why did we build this?

File upload services don't need to have confusing pricing, docs or setup.

Doing file uploads should lack boilerplate altogether.

Object storage is cheap, so why is S3 so expensive?

### Why should you use it?

With Upload-Fast you get:

- The power of Cloudflare's global infrastructure,

- Simple API that just worksâ„¢

- Faster to setup

- Up to 7x cheaper than traditional S3 setups.

- Start with a one-time payment for side projects.

Grab your API key, activate it and add a few lines of code to start uploading files

It's really that simple

```javascript
const upload = await uploadfast.upload(file, {
	apiKey: 'your_api_key',
})

// Your file is ready to use
console.log(upload.url)
```
