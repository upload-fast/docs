## Principles

File upload services don't need to have confusing pricing, docs or setup.

File uploads should lack boilerplate altogether..

File uploads at scale should be cheap now, since object storage is cheap.

### Why use this tool ?

With Upload-Fast you get:

- Cloudlfare's infrastructure,

- Simple API that just works

- Up to 7x cheaper than traditional S3 setups.

- Start with a one-time payment (that's how cheap object storage is..!)

Grab your API key, activate it and add a few lines of code to start uploading files

It's really that simple

```javascript
const upload = await uploadfast.upload(file, {
	apiKey: 'your_api_key',
})

// Your file is ready to use
console.log(upload.url)
```
