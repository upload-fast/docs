#### Obtaining an API Key

- Sign in to the **[uploadfast dashboard](https://www.uploadfast.dev/dashboard)**.
- Create an API key (if you haven't already) by clicking
  **[add new key](https://www.uploadfast.dev/dashboard/keys)**.

Before using the service, you have to activate your project which validates all your API keys.

### Using the API Key

To authenticate your requests, simply include the **api-key** header in your request.

```http
api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

#### Sample request in Node js.

```js
const response = await fetch('https://uploadfast-server.fly.dev/upload', {
 method: 'POST',
 headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    'api-key' : {process.env.UPLOADFAST_KEY}
 },
 body: {} /* Formdata object with your file in there */
});
```

### Javascript SDK

(UploadFast is in early beta, so this API is likely to change)

- Install the SDK

```powershell
pnpm add @uploadfast/client
```

- Upload file.

```js
const fast = createClient({ apiKey: UPLOADFAST_API_KEY })
const fileData = await fast.upload({ resource: file })
const { url, file_name } = fileData[0]
```

The SDK's source code is [here](https://github.com/upload-fast/js-sdk)
